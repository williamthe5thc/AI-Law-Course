                <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
                <p>In this assignment, you will select and explore an AI learning tool that addresses a specific challenge in your learning or professional practice.

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Timeline</h3>
                <p><strong>Total estimated time:</strong> 90 minutes</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tool selection: 20 minutes</li>
                    <li>Document traditional approach: 15 minutes</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Exploration Templates</h2>
            <p>Use the following templates to guide your exploration of an AI learning tool:</p>
            
            <div class="template-section">
                <h3>1. Learning Challenge Identification</h3>
                <p>Describe a specific learning or professional challenge you'd like to address:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What specific task or process do you currently find challenging?</li>
                    <li>Why is this challenge important to your learning or professional practice?</li>
                    <li>How do you currently approach this challenge?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Example: "I struggle with synthesizing information from multiple legal cases quickly. This skill is critical for brief writing and case analysis in my practice. Currently, I read each case fully and take manual notes, which is time-consuming."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="template-section">
                <h3>2. AI Tool Selection</h3>
                <p>Identify an AI tool that might help with your challenge:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which tool did you select and why?</li>
                    <li>What features of this tool seem most relevant to your challenge?</li>
                    <li>Have you used similar tools before? If so, how was your experience?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Example: "I selected Casetext because it offers AI-powered case summarization features. The ability to extract key points automatically seems relevant to my challenge. I've used basic legal research tools but none with AI summarization capabilities."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="template-section">
                <h3>3. Baseline Documentation</h3>
                <p>Document your traditional approach:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe your current step-by-step process</li>
                    <li>Note approximately how long each step takes</li>
                    <li>Identify pain points or inefficiencies in your current approach</li>
                    <li>If possible, save examples of your work using the traditional method</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Example: "My current process involves: 1) Reading the full case (30-45 min per case), 2) Taking detailed notes (15-20 min), 3) Creating a summary (10-15 min)..."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="template-section">
                <h3>4. AI Tool Testing</h3>
                <p>Document your experience using the AI tool:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How did you set up or access the tool?</li>
                    <li>What prompts or inputs did you provide?</li>
                    <li>What results did you receive?</li>
                    <li>What adjustments did you make to improve results?</li>
                    <li>Save examples of your work using the AI tool</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Example: "I created a Casetext account and uploaded the case. I used the 'Key Points' feature, then tried the 'Custom Query' option with the prompt 'summarize the court's reasoning on X issue'..."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="template-section">
                <h3>5. Comparison and Reflection</h3>
                <p>Compare the traditional and AI-assisted approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time comparison: Which method was faster?</li>
                    <li>Quality comparison: Which method produced better results?</li>
                    <li>Efficiency comparison: Which method required less effort?</li>
                    <li>Learning comparison: Which method helped you understand the material better?</li>
                    <li>What surprised you about the AI tool?</li>
                    <li>What limitations did you encounter?</li>
                    <li>How might you integrate this tool into your learning or professional practice?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Example: "The AI-assisted approach was significantly faster (15 min vs. 60 min per case). The quality was acceptable for initial review but missed some nuanced reasoning. I was surprised by how accurate the tool was in identifying key holdings..."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="submission-guidelines">
