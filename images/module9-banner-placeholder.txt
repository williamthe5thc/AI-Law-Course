This is a placeholder for the Module 9 welcome banner.

For your GitHub Pages site, you will need to:
1. Obtain the banner image shown in your Canvas course (the colorful "WELCOME! to module 9" banner)
2. Save it as "module9-banner.jpg" in this directory
3. The CSS is set up to display this at the top of the module page

This banner appears to have a teal background with pink text and circular design elements.
