This is a placeholder for the University of Utah logo. 

For your GitHub Pages site, you will need to:
1. Create or obtain a white "U" logo on a red background
2. Save it as "utah-logo.png" in this directory
3. Make sure it's approximately square (e.g., 60x60 pixels)

The CSS is set up to display this logo in the top-left corner of the sidebar.
